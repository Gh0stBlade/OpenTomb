Overview
========

There are two test levels for TR4 (TRLE revision) demonstrating the use of ultra-high amount of texture pages.

Description
===========

* *newlevel1024.tr4* contains 1024 texture pages. 
* *newlevel2000.tr4* contains 2000 texture pages.

Both levels were successfully loaded by old OpenTomb revisions. Make sure they are correctly loaded when refactoring/rewriting level loader.
